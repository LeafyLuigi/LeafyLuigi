### Hi there, rando! ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on a theme for Discord called "[Pyrite](https://github.com/LeafyLuigi/discord-themes/tree/master/pyrite)".
- Chat with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeafyLuigi). If you need theme support, check the Discord linked somewhere in the readme of the above link.
- I'm currently working with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) on my Discord themes.
- Check my io site [here](https://leafyluigi.github.io) for a bit more than just this stuff.
